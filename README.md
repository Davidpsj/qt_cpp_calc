# qt_cpp_calc
A simple C++ calculator study using Qt Framework.

To start using, just [download](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) the Open Source Qt Creator.  
The 6.1.2 Framework version was used in this project.  

To understand the Framework, don't forget to read the documentation [here](https://doc.qt.io).

Fell free to fork this repository and good studies!
